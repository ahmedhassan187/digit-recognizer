# digit-recognizer
 This project involves deploying a model that recognizes handwritten numbers using the Lenet-5 architecture. The Lenet-5 architecture is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that was introduced in the 1990s and was one of the first CNNs to achieve high accuracy on the MNIST dataset, which is a commonly used benchmark for image classification.
